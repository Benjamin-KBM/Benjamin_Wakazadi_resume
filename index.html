                        A capable self-starter, I am more than happy to collaborate within a team. One of my main passions is
                        longboarding.
                        To become somewhat proficient in the discipline you need to be able to learn quickly on your feet.
                        Often you fail, but quickly you understand what it takes to become better,
                        and I feel that it applies to so many other aspects of life. Not to mention the sense of accomplishment you
                        feel, is almost tangible.
